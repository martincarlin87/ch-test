# Task

A wind turbine has 100 items on it, each get inspected. Write an application that outputs numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three print “Coating Damage” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Lightning Strike” instead of the number. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "Coating Damage and Lightning Strike" instead of the number.

The code to generate the output should be done in PHP (without using any frameworks) and the output should be rendered in HTML with a nice user experience. Share the code to us and show us what you can do.
